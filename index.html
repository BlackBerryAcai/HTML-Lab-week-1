    The IRS's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs offer free basic
    tax
    return preparation to qualified individuals in partnership with CHEC (Community Housing Education Center).

    The VITA program has operated for over 50 years. VITA sites offer free tax help to people who need assistance in
    preparing their own tax returns.

    e-file
    their income tax returns.
